Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an intelligent chatbot leveraging Langchain and Streamlit. The chatbot utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities with the llama2 model from Ollama to provide accurate and helpful responses to user queries.

Features
Langchain Integration: Utilizes Langchain for constructing dynamic chat prompts and integrating the llama2 language model.
Streamlit Interface: Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to input their queries.
Secure Environment Management: Manages environment variables securely using python-dotenv.
Real-Time Responses: Processes and responds to user inputs in real-time, demonstrating efficient handling of natural language queries.
API Utilization: Leverages the Langchain API for enhanced tracing and API management, ensuring robustness and scalability.



Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate`


Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add your Langchain API key:

LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true


Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).
